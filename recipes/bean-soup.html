        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, add the beans and fill it with enough water to completely cover them.</li>
            <li>Add 1 levelled teaspoon of salt and gently stir. Allow them to soak for 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready, drain and wash them well with very cold water.</li>
            <li>Drain again and set aside.</li>
            <li>Chop the celery into 1-2 cm pieces and chop the carrots into 1-2 cm rounds.</li>
            <li>Coarsely chop the onion and thinly slice the garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Place a pot over medium heat and immediately add the olive oil and vegetables, without letting the pot get hot.</li>
            <li>Sauté for 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables soften while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>When all of the juices have evaporated and the vegetables have softened, add the tomato paste and sauté for 1 minute while stirring.</li>
            <li>Add the beans, bay leaves, rosemary, stock cube and the apple. Adding the apple will make our soup thick and creamy. It will be removed when the soup is done.</li>
            <li>Add the water and cover the pot.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 1 – 1 ½ hours.</li>
            <li>Check on the soup from time to time in case a little more water needs to be added. If you do add more water make sure it is boiling so that the boiling process is not interrupted.</li>
            <li>About 10 minutes before the soup is done, add salt and pepper and cover with lid again.</li>
            <li>When ready, remove from heat, remove the apple from the pot and discard.</li>
            <li>Serve soup by adding some chili flakes, extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. If you wish, serve along with feta cheese.</li>
        </ol>
