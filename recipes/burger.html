        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Place a pan over high heat and let it get hot.</li>
            <li>Add some olive oil and the chopped onions.</li>
            <li>Begin sautéing and add the sugar and balsamic vinegar to help them caramelize more.</li>
            <li>Stir every so often until they are perfectly caramelized. The process should take about 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>When ready, remove from heat and set aside until needed.</li>
            <li>Prepare the bacon in another pan. Cook over low heat until crunchy.
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                </li>
            <li>Divide the meat in to 4 equal parts and VERY, very gently mold it in to patties, using little to almost no pressure as possible. Do not season.</li>
            <li>This helps them become as soft and juicy as possible. The more you press or squeeze the meat, the tougher and drier it will turn out!</li>
            <li>Now you can season the meat with salt and pepper on both sides ….and that’s it!</li>
            <li>Use the same pan you prepared the bacon in, without wiping it clean. The juice from the bacon will make the burgers even tastier.</li>
            <li>Add them to the pan and very gently press on them with a spatula, just to flatten them a bit.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with some olive oil and cook according to your preference.</li>
            <li>When they are done on the first side, flip them over and add 1 ½ slices of cheddar and 1 ½ slices of bacon over each patty.</li>
            <li>When ready, remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe down the pan with some paper towels. Add a small amount of olive oil and the hamburger buns. Gently press down on them with your hands and just heat through.</li>
            <li>Place the hamburger bun on a serving plate. Add a little mayonnaise and ketchup or bbq sauce.  Then add the burger, tomato, caramelized onions, lettuce and fresh cucumber pickles.</li>
            <li>Serve with homemade fries.</li>
        </ol>
